Add student into department. Upcoming: Delete student by id

This demo is basically done. By this system, admin can adjust(add/delete) student from a department. Minor adjustions could be multified based on practical needs.
## 2023.10.17
Updating the method by switching Student[] to ArrayList<Student>, which makes the system more adjustable. More updates are on the way!

Comletely developed the whole systems. Future updates would be maintainance and improvement for efficiency. DM for more advice about features.
