Basically done. By this system, admin can adjust(add/delete) student from a department. Minor adjustions could be multified based on practical needs.
## 2023.10.17
Updating the method by switching Student[] to ArrayList<Student>, which makes the system more adjustable. More updates are on the way!
## 2023.10.18
Comletely developed the whole systems. Future updates would be maintainance and improvement for efficiency. DM for more advice about features.
